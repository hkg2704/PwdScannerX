🔐 PwdScanner – Password Strength & Breach Checker Extension

**PwdScanner** is a lightweight and privacy-focused Chrome browser extension that checks the strength of your password and verifies if it has been exposed in a known data breach using the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) API — all without ever sending your full password over the internet.

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ **Real-Time Password Strength Evaluation**  
  Analyzes password strength based on length, character diversity, and symbols.

- 🔎 **Breach Detection via HaveIBeenPwned**  
  Uses k-Anonymity model with SHA-1 hashing to safely check if your password has been compromised.

- 🔐 **Privacy-First**  
  Passwords are hashed locally; only the first 5 characters of the hash are shared (zero risk of password exposure).

- 🎨 **Clean UI**  
  Simple popup interface with feedback, warnings, and password analysis.

- 💡 **Auto-Warning**  
  Automatically shows warnings when typing passwords on any page (optional content script version).
